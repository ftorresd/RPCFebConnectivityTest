## Setup (@lxplus)

Setup the environment:

```
cd /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/slc6_amd64_gcc630/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_10_1_9/ 
cmsenv
cd -
```

Clone the source code:

```
git clone git@github.com:ftorresd/RPCFebConnectivityTest.git
```

Compile:

```
cd RPCFebConnectivityTest
cmake .
make
```

## Running

```
bin/connectivitytest -O output_filename.txt DB_filename.db
```

The .db file was generated by Trigger Supervisor ([documentation](https://www.google.com)).


Three files will be created:
* ```output_filename.txt```: stdout of the analyzer, including diagnoses.
* ```DB_filename.pdf```: configurations used to create the .db and histograms with results.
* ```DB_filename.root```: same as the .pdf, but in root format.
